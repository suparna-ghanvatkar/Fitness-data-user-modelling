Procedure for WISDM dataset:

#transforming the raw files to features: WISDM/unlabelled_raw or raw_labelled folders split files
python raw_tx.py [path_to_raw_file]
#output in [raw_file]_transformed.txt
#now combine these transformed files into one transformed.txt using cat
#do this for labelled, unlabelled and AR dataset
#train the model
python model_train.py [raw_file_transformed] [AR_file_transformed]
#outputs in OVR.pickle and Voting.pickle
python activity_recognition.py [unlabelled_transformed_file] [model.pickle]
#cat and combine both labelled and unlabelled data as COMBINED_ACTIVITY in WISDM dataset folder
python userfiltering.py [combined_act_file] [demographics_file]
#filtered_user_act.csv and filtered_user_demo.csv created
python user_freq_cluster.py [activity_file] [demographics_file] [gap threshold to ignore]
#creates wisdm_activity_timeline.csv and wisdm_gaps.csv and wisdm_userwisedailyactivitytimeline.pickle and wisdm_gapdata.pickle
python timeline_analysis.py [activity pickle][demographics pickle][output csv path name]
#produces svg files and csv file 
python frequent_patterns.py [activity_timeline.csv] [timeline_analysis csv] [granularity for smoothing]
